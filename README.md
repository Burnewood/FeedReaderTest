# Project Overview

In this Udacity project we are required to create a series of tests within the jasmine setup that will accurately determine whether or not the feed reader website is in working condition.

The tests and their results are displayed underneath the existing website for ease of use.

## How to use

by either cloning or downloading this repository , make sure all files are on your system before opening the index.html file included in your browser. As mentioned above, all testing results and details will display below the working page, if you wanted to add extra tests or see how to make them fail change the spec file within the jasmine folder.
